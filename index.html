<h1>Welcome to Anthony's GitHub homepage</h1>
<p>I'm a technical writer in the Dallas, TX area. I have been a technical writer since 2012.</p>

For coding, see my respository of exercises from <i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> <a href="https://github.com/arv0019/ATBS_python">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're just starting out in technical communication and would like to talk, feel free to reach out. If you're a technical writer/editor or in a related field and have advice for feedback for me, please reach out as well.</p>
<p>In addition to my professional interests, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our <a href="https://imgur.com/UG7viXM">tabby cat, Anya, and Great Pyrenees, Brock</a>; playing guitar; and <a href="https://imgur.com/HljzB1t">growing peppers and tomatoes</a></p>.
