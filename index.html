<h1>Welcome to Anthony's GitHub homepage</h1>
<p>I will host writing and coding samples here. I have some elementary knowledge of HTML. I am working on learning more about XML and other structured authoring tools, and <a href="https://github.com/arv0019/ATBS_python">I am currently attempting to learn some Python</a> using <i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i>.</p>
<p>I first became interested in coding in middle school. I developed a small site on Tripod. However, I neglected my coding skills until recently. I have been a technical writer since 2012 and I noticed that many jobs were requiring some coding knowledge, so I picked it back up.</p>
